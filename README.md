CleanIn is a simple Chrome extension that hides unwanted feed content masquerading as real content, such as:

1. Suggested posts  
2. Promoted and Promoted by posts  
3. Sidebar content like News and Puzzles  

They are hidden by default, but you can show them as transparent in the side panel if you prefer (dimmed on the page instead of removed).

The source code is available if you'd prefer to build it yourself: [https://github.com/PeterWCox/CleanIn](https://github.com/PeterWCox/CleanIn). I'm open to adding additional functionality—feel free to e-mail me.

## Caveats
- Only matches the English LinkedIn UI. If your LinkedIn is in French, *toutes mes excuses*.
- LinkedIn could rename "Suggested" to "Things You'll Love" tomorrow and break everything. That's the deal you sign when you scrape a SPA.
- Does not, sadly, hide posts that begin with "Unpopular opinion:".

## License
- MIT. Use it, fork it, ship a better version. Just don't promote it on LinkedIn.
